Real Estate Booking System
I designed and developed a Java-based real estate booking platform using Visual Studio, inspired by Booking.com and Airbnb. The system enables users to browse, book, and review properties, while administrators can manage listings and monitor bookings through an interactive Java Swing interface.

This project challenged me to apply object-oriented programming principles, improve data handling through file-based storage, and enhance user experience with a structured GUI design. It strengthened my ability to build end-to-end software solutions and manage all stages of development â€” from planning and UI design to implementation and testing.

Tech Stack: Java, Swing/AWT, Visual Studio, OOP
